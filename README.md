## About 
> A key to a healthier mind. A step towards a happier tomorrow.

With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, people across the globe have had to adapt to extraordinary amounts of stress coupled with their usual lives. Continuous meetings clog up their calendars and brief periods of breaks are interluded with media based pressure. Anxiet-ease aims to lend users a helping hand, by being a one stop application designed to contain all your needs to calm down. Simply sign up and link your google calendar and let us know when you're anxious to use our novel collection of relaxing measures. Our Machine-Learning algorithms predict future instances of anxiety attacks and preemptively provide you with the relaxation you need to get through the day.

Our application simply provides a clean and easy method of accessibility. It gives users:

- A one stop application with all the information required to monitor your anxiety.
- A space through which they can address any immediate attacks by using our collection of calming techniques.
- The calming techniques include yoga, music, exercise, cooking and cute animal pictures.
- Users will be allowed to enter their own custom methods to calm down and thereby use this app as a compilation of their best ways to relax.
- A calendar and profile to get a weekly or daily view on when attacks are most likely to happen using our ML algorithms to predict future attacks.
- Overall statistics on how their condition fluctuates with time including which calming method works best for them and when.
